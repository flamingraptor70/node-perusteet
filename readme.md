# Assigment for NodeJS basics

## This REST API has basic functionalities of:
- GETting whole list 
- GETting specific item by :id 
- POSTing item with +1 from previous :id
- DELETEing item by :id 
- PUT (updating) details of a specific item by its :id

## Possible problems with building API:
- Understanding different code structure
- Understanding different code functionality
- 204 status code on 'DELETE' function, used 200 instead
- PUT function code overall
